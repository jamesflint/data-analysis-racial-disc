Statistics module exercise: Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Jobs Market

The answers to this assignment are contained in a Jupyter notebook. After a quick look at the data and a pandas dataframe call to establish the appropriate statistics for job callbacks for black-sounding and white-sounding names, I work through the assignment using mathematical analysis appropriate to Bernoulli distributions, documenting my work in MarkDown and MathJax.
